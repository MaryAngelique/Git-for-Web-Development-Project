Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
                A block element always takes up the full width available

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
                It sits on its own layer separate from everything else
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
                <address></address>
